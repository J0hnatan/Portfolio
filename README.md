## About me  
Programming has helped me become a better learner. Typically, for every project, I am required to learn a new language or framework, but to learn each one is all the same. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed learning new things, so programming has only been a pleasure to me.  

Before I learned how to code and how the brain worked, I was but a young boy looking for a promising career and to make my mother proud by going to college. What came after was a young man looking to make the world a better place cemented by his virtues and morals.
